# Course Introduction

If you’re new to the world of modern application development and deployment, this course will give you an overview of cloud native technologies and how container orchestration systems like Kubernetes can help to implement them.

Kubernetes is a very popular open source platform for managing containerized workloads and quickly became a standard job requirement in the IT sector. At the same time, the amount of information about platforms, frameworks and tools can be overwhelming, and finding the right direction is a time-consuming task. Kubernetes provides a framework that enables you to build an individual platform for your workload, and while “batteries are not included”, it can help solve the problems of scaling, load balancing, orchestration, self-healing and configuration management if configured properly.

# Course Learning Objectives
